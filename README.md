# TransferLearning_leaf
This project demonstrates Transfer Learning based Convolutional Neural Network using the leaf dataset found at:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/leaf

Ther are several classes of leaf, but I only employ three types of leaf to be classified.<br>
Such as Aesculus Californica, Erodium Sp, Magnolia Grandiflora<br>
